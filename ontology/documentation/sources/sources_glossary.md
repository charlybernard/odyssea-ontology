    There is a register for built properties and a register for unbuilt properties (which can be found in the same register). The accounts of the taxpayers are called <i>articles</i>. There was no provision for including the developments of a land account. In case of changes, a new article was created in a section of the register dedicated to the current year at the end of the register. The previous taxpayer's article is canceled (crossed out).</td>
